# Options

The options object modifies query behavior, either by applying additional clauses to the query itself or by changing how Massive handles results.

Options can be used with most query functions, and the options object is usually the last parameter passed.

```javascript
db.tests.find({
  is_active: true
}, {
  offset: 20,
  limit: 10,
  only: true,
  stream: true
}).then(stream => {
  // a stream returning the active tests 21-30,
  // omitting rows from any descendant tables
});
```

## SQL Clauses

Certain SQL clauses are used with different types of query. For example, a `LIMIT` clause can only be used with a function which emits a `SELECT` such as `find` or `count`.

| Option key       | Use in | Description |
|------------------|--------|-------------|
| columns          | `SELECT` | Change the `SELECT` list by specifying an array of columns to include in the resultset. |
| limit            | `SELECT` | Set the number of rows to take. |
| offset           | `SELECT` | Set the number of rows to skip. |
| only             | `SELECT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE` | Set to `true` to restrict the query to the table specified, if any others inherit from it. |
| order            | `SELECT` | An array of strings (`['column1', 'column2 DESC']`) which is processed into an `ORDER BY` clause. |
| orderBody        | `SELECT` | If querying a document table, set to `true` to apply `options.order` to fields in the document body rather than the table. |
| onConflictIgnore | `INSERT` | If the inserted data would violate a unique constraint, do nothing. |

*nb. The `columns` and `order` properties allow comma-delimited string as well as array values. Take care when using raw strings since the values are interpolated directly into the emitted SQL. If user input is included in the values, you open yourself up to SQL injection attacks.*

## Results Processing

Results processing options are generally applicable to all query types.

| Option key | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| build      | Set to `true` to return the query text and parameters *without* executing anything. |
| document   | Set to `true` to invoke [document table handling](/documents). |
| single     | Set to `true` to return the first result as an object instead of a results array. |
| stream     | Set to `true` to return results as a stream instead of an array. |
