<p>Massive.js is a data mapper for Node.js that goes all in on PostgreSQL and fully embraces the power and flexibility of the SQL language and relational metaphors. Providing minimal abstractions for the interfaces and tools you already use, its goal is to do just enough to make working with your data as easy and intuitive as possible, then get out of your way.</p>
<p>Massive is <em>not</em> an object-relational mapper (ORM)! It doesn't use models, it doesn't track state, and it doesn't limit you to a single entity-based metaphor for accessing and persisting data. Massive connects to your database and introspects its schemas to build an API for the data model you already have: your tables, views, functions, and easily-modified SQL scripts.</p>
<p>Here are some of the high points:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Dynamic query generation</strong>: Massive's versatile query builder supports a wide variety of operators, all generated from a simple criteria object.</li>
<li><strong>Low overhead</strong>: An API built from your schema means no model classes to maintain, super-simple bulk operations, and direct access to your tables without any need to create or load entity instances beforehand.</li>
<li><strong>Document storage</strong>: PostgreSQL's JSONB storage type makes it possible to blend relational and document strategies. Massive offers a robust API to simplify working with documents: objects in, objects out, with document metadata managed for you.</li>
<li><strong>Relational awareness</strong>: Massive does not traverse relationships or build model graphs, but <a href="https://dmfay.github.io/massive-js/persistence.html#deep-insert">deep inserts</a> can create related entities and junctions transactionally, and the <a href="https://dmfay.github.io/massive-js/decomposition.html"><code>decompose</code> option</a> allows you to map the results of complex views and scripts to nested object trees.</li>
<li><strong>Transactions</strong>: New in v5, use <code>db.withTransaction</code> to execute a callback with full Massive API support in a transaction scope, getting a promise which fulfills if it commits or rejects if it rolls back.</li>
<li><strong>Postgres everything</strong>: Commitment to a single RDBMS lets us use it to its full potential. Massive supports array fields and operations, regular expression matching, foreign tables, materialized views, and more features found in PostgreSQL but not in other databases.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Installation</h2><pre class="prettyprint source"><code>npm i massive --save</code></pre><p><strong>Starting with version 3.0.0, Massive requires ES6 support and uses Promises exclusively. If you need a callback-based API or are using a pre-6.x release of Node.js, install massive@2 or download version 2.x from <a href="https://github.com/dmfay/massive-js/releases">the Releases page</a>.</strong></p>
<p>Examples are presented using the standard <code>then()</code> construction for compatibility, but use of ES2017 <code>async</code> and <code>await</code> or a flow control library such as <a href="https://github.com/tj/co">co</a> to manage promises is highly recommended.</p>
<h2>Connecting to a Database</h2><p>Once installed, <code>require</code> the library and connect to your database with a parameter object or connection string:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint source lang-javascript"><code>const massive = require('massive');

massive({
  host: '127.0.0.1',
  port: 5432,
  database: 'appdb',
  user: 'appuser',
  password: 'apppwd'
}).then(db => {...});</code></pre><p>The returned <code>db</code> object constitutes an API for your schema, with tables, views, functions, and scripts attached. Read on to walk through using them, or <a href="https://dmfay.github.io/massive-js/">consult the documentation</a> for specifics.</p>
<h2>A Brief Example</h2><p>Let's say we have a database for a software testing application. This database contains a <code>tests</code> table and an <code>issues</code> table, where one test may have many issues. In a separate <code>auth</code> schema, it contains a <code>users</code> table referenced by the others to represent a user running a test and discovering issues. There is a <code>test_stats</code> view which calculates statistics on aggregate issue information for individual tests, and a <code>user_tests</code> view which returns all users with their associated tests; and there is a <code>copy_tests</code> function which clones a test for reuse.</p>
<p>Our testing application can leverage the API Massive builds for almost everything it needs to do, but there is one feature that we haven't been able to integrate as a database function yet: the ability to, in one call, clear a test's issues and update its status to signify that it has been restarted. Eventually, we'll get there, but for now it's a SQL script in our application's <code>/db</code> directory, <code>resetTest.sql</code>.</p>
<h3>Persistence</h3><p>After we initialize and connect Massive, all these entities are available on the instance. First, we need to create a user:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint source lang-javascript"><code>db.auth.users.save({
  username: 'alice',
  password: 'supersecure'
}).then(alice => {...});</code></pre><p><code>alice</code> is a JavaScript object containing the username and password we specified. But our <code>users</code> table has more columns than that: first and foremost, there's a primary key, an <code>id</code> column, which uniquely identifies this user record. A user also has a <code>role</code>, a <code>created_at</code> timestamp defaulting to the current date on insert, and an <code>updated_at</code> timestamp to track when the record was last modified. So in addition to the fields we provided, <code>alice</code> has an <code>id</code>, a <code>role</code>, a <code>created_at</code>, and an <code>updated_at</code>. Since we didn't specify values for <code>role</code> or <code>updated_at</code>, these are <code>null</code>.</p>
<p>When Alice resets her password, we issue a <code>save</code> again, including <code>alice</code>'s primary key value:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint source lang-javascript"><code>db.auth.users.save({
  id: 1,
  password: 'evenmoresecure'
}).then(alice => {...});</code></pre><p>The <code>save</code> will search by the primary key in the object and modify only those fields we include. Since Alice's username isn't changing, we don't need to include that in the object we're passing. However, it won't hurt anything if we do, so we could have simply modified the original <code>alice</code> object and passed that in instead.</p>
<p>Now that <code>alice</code> exists in the system, she can start a test. However, we don't want to bother with updating those from the same code path. <code>insert</code> will take care of that:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint source lang-javascript"><code>db.tests.insert({
  name: 'application homepage',
  url: 'http://www.example.com',
  user_id: alice.id
}).then(test => {...});</code></pre><p>Last bit of housekeeping: <code>alice</code> still doesn't have a role, and we may have added more users without roles as well. Let's perform a bulk update to ensure that we're giving people the right access levels:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint source lang-javascript"><code>db.auth.users.update({
  'role is': null
}, {
  role: 'default'
}).then(users => {...});</code></pre><h3>Retrieval</h3><p>Some time later, we want to retrieve that test. But we don't have the object returned from <code>save</code>, so we need to go back to the database with the primary key:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint source lang-javascript"><code>db.tests.findOne(1).then(test => {...});</code></pre><p>In the mean time, Alice has been busy and discovered several problems which are now stored in the <code>issues</code> table. We can see how many she's found with <code>count</code>:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint source lang-javascript"><code>db.issues.count({test_id: 1}).then(total => {...});</code></pre><p>Since Postgres' <code>count</code> returns a 64-bit integer and JavaScript only handles up to 53 bits, <code>total</code> will actually be a string, although thanks to JavaScript's weak typing this generally doesn't matter. Next, let's actually pull out the issue data:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint source lang-javascript"><code>db.issues.find({
  test_id: 1
}, {
  order: [{field: 'created_at', direction: 'desc'}]
}).then(issues => {...});</code></pre><p>The first argument to <code>find</code> is a <a href="https://dmfay.github.io/massive-js/criteria.html">criteria object</a>. Records are matched against each criterion; a key <code>or</code> takes an array of nested criteria objects, at least one of which must be fully matched to qualify for inclusion in the resultset.</p>
<p>The second argument defines <a href="https://dmfay.github.io/massive-js/options.html">options</a> to modify the query behavior; here, we're sorting the issues most recent first. There are many other options which affect query shape and results processing, and the options object can be used with almost all of the retrieval and persistence functions. The output of our <code>find</code> call is the <code>issues</code> array, which contains all records in that table matching the criteria we passed to <code>find</code>.</p>
<p>There are other retrieval functions: <code>where</code> allows us to write more complex <code>WHERE</code> clauses than those <code>find</code> can generate based on the criteria object, and <code>search</code> performs a full-text search against multiple fields in a table. <a href="https://dmfay.github.io/massive-js/queries.html">The documentation</a> has more information on these.</p>
<h3>Deletion</h3><p>After review, it turns out that one of the issues Alice discovered was actually the application working as designed, so she needs to delete the isssue. We can do that with <code>destroy</code>:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint source lang-javascript"><code>db.issues.destroy(3).then(issues => {...});</code></pre><p>The issue has been deleted, and the record returned -- in an array this time, since <code>destroy</code> can be used with a criteria object just like we used <code>find</code> to retrieve multiple issues.</p>
<h3>Functions and Scripts</h3><p>Bob wants to start testing the homepage, but doesn't want to go through the entire setup process. Fortunately, there's a <code>copy_test</code> function which will let him build on Alice's work, if he passes in the test id and his userid to assign the clone to himself:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint source lang-javascript"><code>db.copy_test(test.id, bob.id)
  .then(test => {...})</code></pre><p>There's an important note here: this example assumes that Massive has been initialized with <code>enhancedFunctions</code>. With this flag enabled, Massive detects the shape of database functions' output, and will return a single record object -- or even a scalar value -- as appropriate. Since <code>copy_test</code> only makes one copy, it does return the record object. Without <code>enhancedFunctions</code>, this invocation would return an array containing the single record.</p>
<p>Shortly after Bob starts testing, the application is redeployed underneath him, invalidating the results he's gathered so far. He could delete issues with <code>destroy</code> either individually or in bulk, but it's faster to use the <code>resetTest</code> script. This works exactly as if it were a database function, except that <code>enhancedFunctions</code> does not perform any result type introspection, so the results will always be an array:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint source lang-javascript"><code>db.resetTest(test.id).then(tests => {...});</code></pre><h3>Views and Resultset Decomposition</h3><p>After Alice has finished testing, she wants to see how her results compare to Bob's. We can query the <code>test_stats</code> view just like we did the <code>issues</code> and <code>tests</code> tables, with exactly the same API functions -- the only difference is that, since it's a view, we can't persist data to it.</p>
<pre class="prettyprint source lang-javascript"><code>db.test_stats.find({
  url: 'http://www.example.com'
}).then(stats => {...})</code></pre><p><code>stats</code> is an array of records from the view which match the criteria object.</p>
<p>Many views (or scripts!) combine related results from multiple tables. The <code>user_tests</code> view is one such. Rows might look like this:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>user_id</th>
<th>username</th>
<th>test_id</th>
<th>name</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>1</td>
<td>alice</td>
<td>1</td>
<td>first</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>1</td>
<td>alice</td>
<td>2</td>
<td>second</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>2</td>
<td>bob</td>
<td>3</td>
<td>third</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Databases are limited to working with this kind of information in terms of flat tables and relationships, and when you have a situation where Alice has multiple tests, that means Alice appears twice in the output. In JavaScript, however, we're more accustomed to working with object graphs where, instead of parent entities (users) being duplicated, the descendant entities (tests) are nested. Something like this:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint source lang-javascript"><code>[{
  id: 1,
  username: 'alice',
  tests: [{
    id: 1,
    name: 'first'
  }, {
    id: 2,
    name: 'second'
  }]
}, {
  id: 2,
  username: 'bob',
  tests: [{
    id: 3,
    name: 'third'
  }]
}]</code></pre><p>Massive can transform any view or script result into an object graph with the <a href="https://dmfay.github.io/massive-js/decomposition.html"><code>decompose</code> option</a>. The value of <code>decompose</code> is a schema which represents the desired output format. To generate the structure above:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint source lang-javascript"><code>db.user_tests.find({}, {
  decompose: {
    pk: 'user_id',
    columns: {
      user_id: 'id',
      username: 'username'
    },
    tests: {
      pk: 'test_id',
      columns: {
        test_id: 'id',
        name: 'name'
      },
      array: true
    }
  }
}).then(...)</code></pre><h3>Documents</h3><p>The <code>tests</code> table represents a fairly limited picture of what exactly Alice and Bob are doing. An individual test may have a lot more data associated with it, and this data could be wildly different depending on what precisely is being evaluated, so simply adding more columns to <code>tests</code> isn't really an ideal solution. Postgres' JSONB functionality allows for a more free-form approach than relational databases otherwise support. Working with JSONB fields is certainly possible with the suite of standard table functions, but Massive also allows the dynamic creation and usage of dedicated document tables with a separate set of functions based on the relational data persistence and retrieval functionality.</p>
<p>We can create a document table dynamically by calling <code>saveDoc</code>:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint source lang-javascript"><code>db.saveDoc('test_attributes', {
  productVersion: '1.0.5',
  testEnvironment: 'production',
  web: true,
  accessibilityStandards: ['wcag2a', 'wcag2aa']
}).then(attributes => {...});</code></pre><p>The <code>attributes</code> document is exactly what we passed in, with the addition of an autogenerated primary key. The key is never stored in the document body itself, but is automatically unwrapped when you persist the document.</p>
<p>Once the document table has been created, it's available just like any other table. You can retrieve the document again with the primary key, or query for an array of documents matching criteria:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint source lang-javascript"><code>db.test_attributes.findDoc(1)
  .then(attributes => {...});

db.test_attributes.findDoc({web: true})
  .then(matchingDocuments => {...});</code></pre><p>Count documents with criteria:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint source lang-javascript"><code>db.test_attributes.count({web: true})
  .then(total => {...});</code></pre><p>Perform a full-text search against the values in the document:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint source lang-javascript"><code>db.test_attributes.searchDoc({
  fields : [&quot;testEnvironment&quot;, &quot;environment&quot;, &quot;applicationStatus&quot;],
  term : &quot;production&quot;
}.then(matchingDocuments => {...});</code></pre><p>Persistence functions are also adapted for document tables. You can update/insert a document with <code>saveDoc</code>; if the argument contains an <code>id</code> field, it will update the existing document in the database. If the argument contains no <code>id</code> field then it will insert a new document into the database. Either way, it returns the current state of the document.</p>
<p>This is not a true upsert! <code>saveDoc</code>, like <code>save</code>, determines whether to emit an <code>INSERT</code> or an <code>UPDATE</code> based on whether the data <em>you</em> pass it contains a primary key. If you are generating primary keys manually, use <code>insert</code> instead -- if you specify a value for the primary key, it will execute an <code>UPDATE</code> whether or not the row actually exists in the database, and if it does not the result will be <code>null</code>.</p>
<pre class="prettyprint source lang-javascript"><code>attributes.requiresAuthentication = true;

db.test_attributes.saveDoc(attributes)
  .then(attributes => {...});</code></pre><p>Note that <code>saveDoc</code> replaces the <em>entire</em> document. To change fields without having to retrieve the document, use <code>updateDoc</code>:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint source lang-javascript"><code>db.test_attributes.updateDoc(1, {
  requiresAuthentication: false
}).then(attributes => {...});</code></pre><p><code>updateDoc</code>, like <code>saveDoc</code>, returns the current version of the entire document. <code>updateDoc</code> can also perform bulk operations with a criteria object and a changes object, just like the relational <code>update</code>:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint source lang-javascript"><code>db.test_attributes.updateDoc({
  web: true
}, {
  browser: 'Chrome'
}).then(changedAttributesDocs => {...});</code></pre><p>When used with a criteria object, <code>updateDoc</code> returns an array containing all updated documents.</p>
<h3>Arbitrary Queries</h3><p>Last but not least: sometimes you just need to write some SQL. Alice's and Bob's passwords are both stored as plain text, because we were originally more focused on getting up and running than we were on doing things right. Now it's time to rectify this, especially since we've started adding new users through a system that hashes and salts passwords with a <code>hash</code> database function and our application login expects passwords to be hashed. So we need to ensure that all our users have hashed passwords, which we can do with an ad-hoc query in the REPL:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint source lang-javascript"><code>db.query(
  'update users set password = hash(password) where id &lt; $1 returning *',
  [3]
).then(users => {...});</code></pre><p>The value returned is an array of rows, assuming the query returns anything. <code>query</code> is most useful for one-offs like this, or for testing when you don't want to have to reload the database API to get changes to a script file. Once the query is ready for regular use, though, it's best to put it in a file in your scripts directory so you have all your scripts in a central location.</p>
<h2>REPL</h2><p>Massive.js ships with a REPL (read-evaluate-print loop), an interactive console that lets you connect to a database and execute JavaScript code. The easiest way to run it is to install globally:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint source"><code>npm i -g massive</code></pre><p>You can then fire up a connection and start writing JavaScript:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint source"><code>massive -d appdb

db > db.listTables();
[ 'tests',
  'users' ]

db > db.tests.find({user_id: 1}).then(tests => {...});</code></pre><p>In addition to the <code>tables</code> collection, the <code>views</code> and <code>functions</code> collections are also exposed on the database object.</p>
<p>When invoking functions, you may omit the <code>then</code> if you just want to see output -- Massive provides a resolver which logs the results to make it easy to query with the REPL.</p>
<p>Exit the REPL by pressing Ctrl-C twice.</p>
