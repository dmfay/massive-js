# Options

The options object modifies query behavior, either by applying additional clauses to the query itself or by changing how Massive handles results.

Options can be passed to most query and persistence functions as the final argument.

```javascript
db.tests.find({
  is_active: true
}, {
  fields: ['name', 'started_at'],
  exprs: {
    lowername: 'lower(name)',
    total: 'passes + failures'
  },
  offset: 20,
  limit: 10,
  only: true,
  stream: true
}).then(stream => {
  // a stream returning the name, start date, lower-
  // cased name, and pass + failure total for active
  // tests 21-30, omitting rows from any descendant
  // tables
});
```

## SQL Clauses

Certain SQL clauses are used with different types of query. For example, a `LIMIT` clause can only be used with a function which emits a `SELECT` such as `find` or `count`.

| Option key       | Use in | Description |
|------------------|--------|-------------|
| fields           | `SELECT` | Specify an array of column names to include in the resultset. The names will be quoted; use `exprs` to invoke functions or operate on columns. |
| exprs            | `SELECT` | Specify a map of aliases to expressions to include in the resultset. **Do not send user input directly into `exprs` unless you understand the risk of SQL injection!** |
| limit            | `SELECT` | Set the number of rows to take. |
| offset           | `SELECT` | Set the number of rows to skip. |
| only             | `SELECT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE` | Set to `true` to restrict the query to the table specified, if any others inherit from it. |
| order            | `SELECT` | An array of order objects (see below) or a literal string in the form `column1 ASC, column2 DESC`. **Avoid sending user input as a literal string. If you have to, be aware of the possibility of SQL injection.** |
| orderBody        | `SELECT` | If querying a document table, set to `true` to apply `options.order` to fields in the document body rather than the table. |
| onConflictIgnore | `INSERT` | If the inserted data would violate a unique constraint, do nothing. |
| deepInsert       | `INSERT` | Specify `false` when passing a record object which contains keys that do not represent columns or junctions to prevent Massive from trying to handle the extra data. |

**nb. The `exprs`, `order`, and the deprecated `columns` options interpolate values into the emitted SQL. Take care with raw strings and ensure that user input is never directly passed in through the options, or you risk opening yourself up to SQL injection attacks.**

### Ordering Results

The `order` option may be passed an array of order objects. These are used to build a SQL `ORDER BY` clause. An order object must contain a `field`; all other properties are optional.

* `field`: The name of the column being sorted on. May be a JSON path if sorting by an element nested in a JSON field or document table body. The column name will be quoted unless `raw` is also specified.
* `direction`: The sort direction, `ASC` or `DESC`.
* `type`: Define a cast type for values. Useful with JSON fields.
* `raw`: True to leave the `field` unquoted. Useful if you're ordering by something other than a single column value, for example `col1 + col2`.

## Results Processing

Results processing options are generally applicable to all query types, although `stream` is principally useful with query functions.

| Option key | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| build      | Set to `true` to return the query text and parameters *without* executing anything. |
| document   | Set to `true` to invoke [document table handling](/massive-js/documents). |
| single     | Set to `true` to return the first result as an object instead of a results array. |
| stream     | Set to `true` to return results as a stream instead of an array. Streamed results cannot be `decompose`d. |
| decompose  | Provide a schema to transform the results into an object graph (see below). Not compatible with `stream`. |

### Decomposition Schemas

The `decompose` option takes a schema which represents the desired output structure. A schema is a JavaScript object with a few specific properties, and which may contain further schemas.

* `pk` (for "primary key") specifies the field in the resultset which uniquely identifies the entity represented by this schema. Decomposition currently only supports unary primary keys and does not work with compound keys.
* `columns` is either a map of fields in the resultset (keys) to fields in the output entity (values), or an array of field names if they do not need to be transformed.
* `array` is only usable on schemas nested at least one level deep. If `true`, the entities this schema represents are considered a collection instead of a nested object.

Any other key on a schema is taken to represent a nested schema, and nested schemas **may not be named** with one of the reserved keys. The following schema:

```javascript
db.user_tests.find({}, {
  decompose: {
    pk: 'user_id',
    columns: ['user_id', 'username'],
    tests: {
      pk: 'test_id',
      columns: {
        test_id: 'id',
        name: 'name'
      },
      array: true
    }
  }
}).then(...)
```

will transform this recordset:

```javascript
[
  {user_id: 1, username: 'alice', test_id: 1, name: 'first'},
  {user_id: 1, username: 'alice', test_id: 2, name: 'second'},
  {user_id: 2, username: 'bob', test_id: 3, name: 'third'},
]
```

into this:

```javascript
[{
  user_id: 1,
  username: 'alice',
  tests: [{
    id: 1,
    name: 'first'
  }, {
    id: 2,
    name: 'second'
  }]
}, {
  user_id: 2,
  username: 'bob',
  tests: [{
    id: 3,
    name: 'third'
  }]
}]
```

This can also be used with raw SQL through `db.query`. Note that options need to be passed as the third argument, as the second argument is used for params.

```javascript
db.query(
  `select u.id as u_id, u.name as u_name, u.address as u_address,
    t.id as t_id, t.score as t_score
    from users u
    inner join tests t on t.user_id = u.id`,
  [],
  {
    decompose: {
      pk: 'id',
      columns: {u_id: 'id', u_name: 'name', u_address: 'address'},
      tests: {
        pk: 't_id',
        columns: {t_id: 'id', t_score: 'score'},
        array: true
      }
    }
  }
).then(...)
```

The `decompose` option can be applied to any result set, although it will generally be most useful with views and scripts.
