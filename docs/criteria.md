# Criteria Objects

Many Massive functions use criteria objects to build `WHERE` clauses. Although they are principally used in query functions, there are other uses for them. In particular, bulk updates use criteria objects to filter the records being modified.

A criteria object is a "plain old JavaScript object" where keys represent the fields to search and values are prepared statement parameters. The key `or` is special and takes an array of nested criteria objects, at least one of which must be fully matched for a record to be included in the resultset. `or` may be nested recursively at any depth.

```javascript
// this will search for all active records where the name
// contains 'homepage' or the JSON 'stats' field shows
// more than 5 runs

const criteria = {
  is_active: true,
  or: [{
    'name like': '%homepage%'
  }, {
    'stats.runs >': 5
  }]
};
```

## Operations

Keys in a criteria object may contain an operator which is converted to a SQL operator in the `WHERE` clause. **If no operator is provided, the predicate will test for equality.**

Text operator keys are case-insensitive.

### Scalar Comparison

| Format | SQL operator | Description|
|--------|--------------|------------|
| nothing or `=` | `=` | Equality |
| `!`, `!=`, `<>` | `<>` | Inequality |
| `<` | `<`| Less than |
| `<=` | `<=` | Less than or equal |
| `>` | `>` | Greater than |
| `>=` | `>=` | Greater than or equal |
| nothing or `=` | `IN` | Test whether value is in an array of scalar expressions |
| `BETWEEN` | `BETWEEN` | Test whether value is between the `[lower, upper]` bounds of a 2-element array |
| `IS` | `IS` | Explicit equality test for `NULL` and boolean values |
| `IS NOT` | `IS NOT` | Explicit inequality test for `NULL` and boolean values |
| `IS DISTINCT FROM` | `IS DISTINCT FROM` | Difference test with `NULL` considered a fixed value |
| `IS NOT DISTINCT FROM` | `IS NOT DISTINCT FROM` | Equality test with `NULL` considered a fixed value |

### Arrays

| Format | SQL operator | Description|
|--------|--------------|------------|
| `@>` | `@>` | Array contains |
| `<@` | `<@` | Array contained in |
| `&&` | `&&` | Array overlaps |

### Pattern Matching

| Format | SQL operator | Description|
|--------|--------------|------------|
| `~~`, `LIKE` | `LIKE` | Case-sensitive string equality with `%` and `_` wildcards |
| `!~~`, `NOT LIKE` | `NOT LIKE` | Case-sensitive string difference with `%` and `_` wildcards |
| `~~*`, `ILIKE` | `ILIKE` | Case-insensitive string equality with `%` and `_` wildcards |
| `!~~*`, `NOT ILIKE` | `NOT ILIKE` | Case-insensitive string difference with `%` and `_` wildcards |

### Regular Expressions

| Format | SQL operator | Description|
|--------|--------------|------------|
| `SIMILAR TO` | `SIMILAR TO` | SQL regular expression match |
| `NOT SIMILAR TO` | `NOT SIMILAR TO` | SQL regular expression mismatch |
| `~` | `~` | Case-sensitive POSIX regular expression match |
| `!~` | `!~` | Case-sensitive POSIX regular expression mismatch |
| `~*` | `~*` | Case-insensitive POSIX regular expression match |
| `!~*` | `!~*` | Case-insensitive POSIX regular expression mismatch |

## Casting

PostgreSQL can cast values with the `::` operator. Massive's criteria object supports this exactly as in SQL. For example, to convert a UUID field to TEXT for pattern matching, you could create a criteria object as follows:

```javascript
const criteria = {
  'my_uuid::text LIKE': '12345%'
};
```

## JSON Traversal

Massive supports searching in JSON and JSONB fields using idiomatic JavaScript paths. Use dots to traverse fields, and [] brackets to denote array indices. JSON traversal may be combined with SQL operations and casts (the cast applies to the value in the JSON field at the specified path, not to the JSON field itself).
